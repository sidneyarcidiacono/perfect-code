## The Only Code Review API That Makes You Better

PerfectCode aims to allow users to upload their code files, and receive a review and corrections of styling inconsistencies or errors. Focused on allowing the user the opportunity to improve, PerfectCode allows users to create an account with their code submission history, so they can see common issues and work to improve.


*Later on, I would love for PerfectCode to point out specific common issues in users' code, to more clearly provide them room for improvement. But this is a "stretch", so to speak*

PerfectCode leverages the DeepCode API, found [here](https://deepcode.ai/docs)
